I think because I did it from start to finish, so I designed the shoe initially in Sketch (which is this design tool), and then after that I converted that drawing into code that would make it easier to interact with. Then I actually wrote the component that would preview the shoe, so it would appear on the page, and finally I made it interactable - by being able to give the component a shoe color and the shoe would change color according to that color that was passed to it. So I guess I have a special attachment to it because I feel like I 'made' the shoe.
